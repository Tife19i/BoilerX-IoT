# BoilerX-IoT

BoilerX-IoT is a full end-to-end IoT system that monitors boiler room temperature in real time and compares it with outside weather forecast data. The system combines embedded hardware, cloud services and a web application to give a complete monitoring solution.

 Features
 DESP32 microcontroller reads temperature from sensors and handles Wi-Fi connectivity  
 Arduino firmware logs sensor data and sends it to **Firebase Realtime Database** in real time  
 Firebase Realtime Database stores live data and logs for historical analysis  
 React.js web application displays live temperature, historical logs, system settings, and device information  
 Supports multiple devices with user authentication and identification  

 What’s included
 Arduino firmware for ESP32-C3  
 React.js web app code  
 Firebase setup and sample logs (screenshots included)  
 KiCad schematics, PCB layout, and 3D models  

This repository contains all files and designs for the project making it easy to explore the hardware, software and cloud integration.
