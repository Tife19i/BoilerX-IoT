* Prototype

This folder contains the design files and images for the BoilerX-IoT prototype. The prototype is built on a custom PCB that integrates the ESP32, temperature sensors (LM35 and LM335), and other components.

 Key Components
- **ESP32**: The microcontroller that handles data processing and communication.
- **LM35 and LM335**: Temperature sensors used for accurate temperature measurement.
- **PCB Layout**: Custom-designed board to house all components and ensure stable operation.

 Files Included
- **Schematics**: Detailed circuit diagrams.
- **PCB Design**: Layout files and Gerber files for manufacturing.
- **Prototype Images**: Photos showing the assembled PCB and testing setup.

 Design Considerations
- **Sensor Placement**: Proper placement of the LM35 and LM335 for accurate readings.
- **Power Supply**: Voltage regulation and battery integration for standalone operation.
